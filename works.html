            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                I choose to live gently, preferring simplicity in all things and understand that a meaningful life does not require excess to be complete. In simplicity, I find clarity and balance; in sabr, I learn to endure with grace; and in tawakkul, I place my trust in what is written beyond my control. Through my life, works, and writings, I strive to move with sincerity, maintaining balance, doing my part with quiet effort, and allowing faith to guide the rest.

            <h2>Religion – Islam</h2>
            <p>
                My religion is Islam, and it grounds every part of my life, shaping my values with humility, discipline, and sincerity. It teaches me to practice sabr in times of difficulty and to place my trust in Allah through tawakkul in all outcomes. Through prayer, reflection, and intention, I am reminded to live with purpose and accountability. Islam, for me, is both guidance and peace in the journey of becoming.

            <h2>Art – Digital Art</h2>
            <p>
                This digital artwork is my first creation and my initial step into expressing myself through art. It reflects my belief in simplicity, the guidance of Islam, and the quiet strength found in perseverance. Through subtle elements and intentional restraint, it represents growth, both personal and spiritual, as a continuous journey shaped by faith and reflection.

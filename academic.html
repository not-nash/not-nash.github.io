            <p>
                This formal image marks a significant milestone in my academic life, where I was elected as Public Information Officer of a club with over 1,000 members. In the same year, I was also elected as class president, served as the senior high school representative of the Muslim Student Organization in Liceo, and became part of the student council. Beyond campus, I actively participated in the Muslim Youth Council in Cagayan de Oro, making the experience both humbling and rewarding as it shaped my leadership through service, responsibility, and purpose.

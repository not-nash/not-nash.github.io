                A beach day with friends turned into an unexpected moment when they discovered I was photogenic, which led them to take another shot. Surrounded by laughter, sea breeze, and sunlight, it felt carefree and real, one of those memories that stays warm long after the waves fade.

            <p>
                Wearing my full uniform at Liceo de Cagayan University this April 2025 felt like a quiet reminder of how far I’ve come and how much I’m still becoming. In this moment, pride, pressure, and purpose all blended together, a snapshot of growth, dreams, and the journey I’m choosing to walk.

                A quiet night by the beach, captured on a digi camera by a friend, holding a smile that felt effortless and real. With the sound of waves and the calm of the dark sky, it was a simple moment that meant more than it looked.

                My first selfie inside the mosque at Mindanao State University–Iligan Institute of Technology captured a moment of quiet awe. I was astonished by the beauty of the space and felt an instant sense of belonging on the campus.
